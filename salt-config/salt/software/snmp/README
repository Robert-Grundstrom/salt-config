This state will install the snmp deamon and configure a
read only user using snmpv3. This is a secure and encrypted
version of snmp.

Usage for this is to setup a way to monitor your system
most monitor software supports snmpv3
(Examples are Zabbix or OP5.)

# Pillar example/defaults.
# Default setting if pillar is not defined.
# -----------------------------------------
software:
  snmp:
    user: rouser
    sha: monkeylikebanana
    aes: monkeyhasbanana
    bind: 0.0.0.0
# -----------------------------------------


# NOTE:
# The user and passwords will only get pushed to the system
# if there is a change in the packet.
#
# i.e a packet update/fresh install.
#
# Reason for this is that salt pushes this information
# in clear text. If you need to update the user and passwords
# the easiest way is to remove the snmp packet.
#
# For CentOS/Redhat:
#    yum -y remove net-snmp
#
# For Ubuntu/Debian:
#    apt -y remove snmpd
#
# And then run the snmp salt state.
