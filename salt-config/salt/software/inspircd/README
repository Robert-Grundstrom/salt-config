A BASH script will be created '/etc/inspircd/sslkeys/create-cert.sh' this is to create / renew 
ssl certificates when requiered. Salt will not renew the certificate automatically if its expiered.
The certificate is valid for 1095 days (3 Years) from its creation date.

InspIRCd is a modular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server written in C++ for Linux, BSD, Windows and Mac OS X systems.

It was created from scratch to be stable, modern and lightweight.
It avoids a number of design flaws and performance issues that plague other more established projects,
such as UnrealIRCd, while providing the same level of feature parity.

It provides a tunable number of features through the use of an advanced but well documented module system.
By keeping core functionality to a minimum we hope to increase the stability,
security and speed of InspIRCd while also making it customisable to the needs of many different users.
