# LDAP authentication module: Adds the ability to authenticate users  #
# via LDAP. This is an extra module which must be enabled explicitly  #
# by symlinking it from modules/extra, and requires the OpenLDAP libs #
# This module is in extras. To enable it, Re-run configure with:      #
# ./configure --enable-extras=m_ldapauth.cpp                          #
# and run make install, then uncomment this module.                   #

# The baserdn indicates the base DN to search in for users. Usually   #
# this is 'ou=People,dc=yourdomain,dc=yourtld'.                       #
#                                                                     #
# The attribute value indicates the attribute which is used to locate #
# a user account by name. On POSIX systems this is usually 'uid'.     #
#                                                                     #
# The useusername setting chooses whether the user's username or      #
# nickname is used when locating a user account, if a username isn't  #
# provided in PASS.                                                   #
#                                                                     #
# The server parameter indicates the LDAP server to connect to. The   #
# ldap:// style scheme before the hostname proper is MANDATORY.       #
#                                                                     #
# The allowpattern value allows you to specify a wildcard mask which  #
# will always be allowed to connect regardless of if they have an     #
# account, for example guest users.                                   #
#                                                                     #
# Killreason indicates the QUIT reason to give to users if they fail  #
# to authenticate.                                                    #
#                                                                     #
# The searchscope value indicates the subtree to search under. On our #
# test system this is 'subtree'. Your mileage may vary.               #
#                                                                     #
# Setting the verbose value causes an oper notice to be sent out for  #
# every failed authentication to the server, with an error string.    #
#                                                                     #
# The binddn and bindauth indicate the DN to bind to for searching,   #
# and the password for the distinguished name. Some LDAP servers will #
# allow anonymous searching in which case these two values do not     #
# need defining, otherwise they should be set similar to the examples #
# above.                                                              #
#                                                                     #
# ldapwhitelist indicates that clients connecting from an IP in the   #
# provided CIDR do not need to authenticate against LDAP. It can be   #
# repeated to whitelist multiple CIDRs.                               #
#                                                                     #
# ldaprequire allows further filtering on the LDAP user, by requiring #
# certain LDAP attibutes to have a given value. It can be repeated,   #
# in which case the list will act as an OR list, that is, the         #
# authentication will succeed if any of the requirements in the list  #
# is satisfied.                                                       #
#                                                                     #
# host allows you to change the displayed host of users connecting    #
# from ldap. The string supplied takes formatters which are replaced  #
# from the DN. For instance, if your DN looks like:                   #
# uid=w00t,ou=people,dc=inspircd,dc=org, then the formatters uid, ou  #
# and dc will be available to you. If a key is given multiple times   #
# in the DN, the last appearance will take precedence.
