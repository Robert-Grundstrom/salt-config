This is a small projekt that should serve as a baseline
for Linux servers. The idea is to use Saltstack to setup
Network, NTP, SSH, SNMPv3, Firewall in a correct way as
well as bump up the security of the clients.

In my experience ive seen a lot of diffrent enviorments
and none of them are thinking about the basic security 
options that should be standard in todays IT enviorments.

Every company out there that ive come accross has a firewall
beetween the Internet and the local network. But many attacks
today come from the inside of the company and the damage
of internal attacks can be minimized by setting up basic security.

Reason i choose to include SNMPv3 in this is for monitoring purpose.
Zabbix and OP5 is the most common tools that ive come accross that 
is used and with SNMPv3 you can monitor your services with a secure
and encrypted way that is supported by thease tools.

Before you start using this make sure that pillars are matching your
enviorment and purposes. Otherwise you might break your system or
lock yourself out.
